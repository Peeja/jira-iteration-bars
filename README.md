# jira-sparkboard (WIP)

A userscript to add a tiny kanban-board-style visualization to Jira epics
showing the states of the cards in that epic.

Or it will be soon. Currently, it's a demonstration of using a userscript
with shadow DOM to override (or "enhance") elements of any website, with Hot
Module Replacement support in development. Start it up, make it override
something on the web (like a Jira card component), edit your override code, and
see your changes update in the browser in real time! Eventually, this will be
its own library, but for now it's the foundation of jira-sparkboard.
